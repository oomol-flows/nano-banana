title: "Nano Banana Edit"
icon: ":carbon:edit:"
description: "Submits image editing requests to the Nano Banana AI model via the
  OOMOL Fusion API. This task initiates asynchronous image processing jobs that
  can modify, enhance, or transform images based on natural language
  instructions. It accepts multiple image URLs and a text prompt, then returns a
  response object containing a request ID for tracking the job. The actual
  edited images are retrieved separately using the nano-banana-get-result task.
  Common use cases include style transfer, object modification, background
  replacement, color adjustments, and creative image transformations."
